# Chess

Chess is one of the oldest games around and is thought to have been brought to the western world from India via Persia in the 7th century. Back then it was known as Chaturanga, had a few different pieces, but the same principles remain with only a few minor changes being implemented in recent years. Nowadays chess is played in every country with Russia having the most grandmasters.

# A Few Rules...

## generics:
* If any piece of the player finishes their move on the same square as a piece of the opposing colour, then the opponent's piee is removed from th game, and the player's piece claims that square.
* A player's piece may not take the place of any of their own pieces.

## Pawns:
* Pawns move one square directly in front of them per turn.
* They can take an opposing piece that is either directly diagonally to the right or directly diagonally to the left.
* If they reach the other side of the board, they will be 'promoted' to a queen.

## Bishops:
* Bishops can move in all 4 directions diagonally like an X.
* As long as their paths are unobstructed, bishops move multiple squares in one turn.
* Bishops cannot 'jump' over pieces.

## Knights:
* Knights move in an L shape.
  * Imagine you draw an L with the squares on the board.
  * 2 squares away from the knight makes the stem of the L
  * One square on either side of the stem finishes the knights move.
* Knights can 'jump' over any piece on the board.

## Rooks:
* Rooks can move in all 4 directions up and down like a +.
* As long as their paths are unobstructed, rooks move multiple squares in one turn.
* Rooks cannot 'jump' over pieces.

## Queens:
* Queens can move as though a bishop and a rook combined.
* She is the most powerful piece on the board, use her well.

## Kings:
* Kings can move in any direction at all but only one square at a time.
* Kings are invaluable. If you lose him, you lose the game, so take care of him.

## Castleing:

Castling is when both the king and either rook can move in the same turn to 'swap' places The rules are as follows:

1. The King and Rook may not have moved from their starting squares
2. All spaces between the King and Rook must be empty
3. The King cannot be in Check
4. The squares the King will pass over may not be under attack, nor can the square on which the King will land


## Icebox Items...

* En-Passant
* Stalemate logic
* If a player is in check, inform them!

## As convention states, white plays first. Click any piece to [start the game](https://jackhr.github.io/chess-project). The first person to take their opponent's king will be crowned victor! Good luck...
