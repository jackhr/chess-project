# Chess

Chess is one of the oldest games around and is thought to have been brought to the western world from India via Persia in the 7th century. Back then it was known as Chaturanga, had a few different pieces, but the same principles remain with only a few minor changes being implemented in recent years. Nowadays chess is played in every country with Russia having the most grandmasters.
